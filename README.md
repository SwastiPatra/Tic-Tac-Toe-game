# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Created a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we will be able to play against the computer. Initially, I have made an empty game board which will take inputs from the players and check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled, the results will be declared as “You won” or “You lost”.
